#Docker OpenStack Swift onlyone

This is a docker file that creates an OpenStack swift image which has only one replica and only one device. Why would this be useful? I think that Docker and OpenStack Swift go together like peas and carrots. Distributed files systems are a pain, so why not just use OpenStack Swift? Scaling is not as much of an issue with object storage. Many Docker containers, even on separate hosts, can use one OpenStack Swift container to persist files.
